# Intruder-Detection-System-using-OpenCV

 This code implements a webcam-based intruder detection system using OpenCV and Python. The code continuously captures frames from the webcam and compares them to an initial frame. It analyzes the differences between frames and triggers an alarm if significant changes are detected, indicating a potential intrusion. The system provides an interactive mode where the user can activate or deactivate the alarm. When activated, the system displays a thresholded frame highlighting the detected differences. The user can also exit the program by pressing a specific key.
